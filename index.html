          <h2>Facts about Doggies</h2>
          <p>
            Dogs have a sense of time but do not understand the concept of time.
            Unlike humans, dogs do not have the ability to create actual
            measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they do not
            know how to read clocks. So, telling them ”I will be back in 15
            minutes” would not really do much, but we understand that you feel
            like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained
            based on past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events
            based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of
            this.

            The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the
            domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the
            modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the
            first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000
            years ago before the development of agriculture.
